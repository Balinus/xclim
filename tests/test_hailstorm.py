"""Tests for `hailstorm` package.

We want to tests multiple things here:
 - that data results are correct
 - that metadata is correct and complete
 - that missing data are handled appropriately
 - that various calendar formats and supported
 - that non-valid input frequencies or holes in the time series are detected


For correctness, I think it would be useful to use a small dataset and run the original ICCLIM indicators on it, saving
the results in a reference netcdf dataset. We could then compare the hailstorm output to this reference as a first line
of defense.
