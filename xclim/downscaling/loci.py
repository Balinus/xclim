def train(
    x, y, group="time.dayofyear", window=1, thresh=None,
):
    r"""
    Return multiplicative correction factors such that the mean of `x` matches the mean of `y` for values above a
    threshold.

    The threshold on the training target `y` is first mapped to `x` by finding the quantile in `x` having the same
    exceedance probability as thresh in `y`. The correction factor is then given by

    .. math::

       s = \frac{\left \langle y: y \geq t_y \right\rangle - t_y}{\left \langle x : x \geq t_x \right\rangle - t_x}

    In the case of precipitations, the correction factor is the ratio of wet-days intensity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : xr.DataArray
      Training data, usually a model output whose biases are to be corrected.
    y : xr.DataArray
      Training target, usually a reference time series drawn from observations.
    group : {'time.season', 'time.month', 'time.dayofyear', 'time'}
      Grouping dimension and property. If only the dimension is given (e.g. 'time'), the correction is computed over
      the entire series.
    window : int
      Length of the rolling window centered around the time of interest used to estimate the quantiles. This is mostly
      used with group `time.dayofyear` to increase the number of samples.
    thresh : float
      Threshold under which values are assumed null for `y`. For precipitations, this is the wet-day threshold.

    Returns
    -------
    xr.Dataset with variables:
        - cf : The correction factors indexed by group properties
        - x_thresh : The threshold over `x` indexed by group properties
        - y_thresh : The threshold over `y`.

        The grouping informations are in the "group" and "group_window" attributes.

def predict(x, c, interp="linear"):
    r"""
    Return a multiplicative bias-corrected time series for values above a threshold.

    Given a correction factor `s`, return the series

    .. math::

      p(t) = \max\left(t_y + s \cdot (x(t) - t_x), 0\right)

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : xr.DataArray
      Time series to be bias-corrected, usually a model output.
    c : xr.Dataset
      Dataset returned by `loci.train`.
    interp : {'nearest', 'linear', 'cubic'}
      The interpolation method used to find the correction factors from the quantile map. See utils.broadcast.

    Returns
    -------
    xr.DataArray
      The bias-corrected time series.
