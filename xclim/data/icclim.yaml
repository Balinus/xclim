  ==============
  ICCLIM indices
  ==============
  The European Climate Assessment & Dataset project (`ECAD`_) defines
  a set of 26 core climate indices. Those have been made accessible
  directly in xclim through their ECAD name for compatibility. However,
  the methods in this module are only wrappers around the corresponding
  methods of  `xclim.indices`. Note that none of the checks performed by
  the `xclim.utils.Indicator` class (like with `xclim.atmos` indicators)
  are performed in this module.
