    "`xclim` gives users the ability to generate their own modules from existing indices library. These mappings can help in emulating existing libraries (such as ICCLIM), with the added benefit of CF-compliant metadata, multilingual metadata support, and optimized calculations using federated resources (using Dask). This can be used for example to tailor existing indices with predefined thresholds without having to rewrite indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Presently, xclim is capable of approximating the indices developed in ICCLIM (https://icclim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html), ANUCLIM (https://fennerschool.anu.edu.au/files/anuclim61.pdf) and clix-meta (https://github.com/clix-meta/clix-meta) and is open to contributions of new indices and library mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as an example of how one might go about creating their own library of mapped indices. Two ways are possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From a YAML file (recommended way)\n",
    "2. From a mapping of indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "## YAML file\n",
    "\n",
    "The first method is based on the YAML syntax proposed by `clix-meta`, expanded to xclim's needs. The full documentation on that syntax is [here](../api.rst#module-xclim.core.indicator). This notebook shows a minimal example, creating a YAML file and then a module from it."
