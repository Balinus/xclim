    "## LOESS smoothing and detrending\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in Cleveland (1979), locally weighted linear regressions are multiple regression methods using a nearest-neighbor approach. Instead of using all datapoints to compute a linear or polynomial regression, LOESS algorithms compute a local regression for each point in the dataset, using only the k-nearest neighbors as selected by a weighting function. This weighting function must fulfill some strict requirements, see the doc of `xclim.sdba.loess.loess_smoothing` for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "In xclim's implementation, the user can choose between local _constancy_ ($d=0$, local estimates are weighted averages) and local _linearity_ ($d=1$, local estimates are taken from linear regressions). Two weighting functions are currently implemented : \"tricube\" ($w(x) = (1 - x^3)^3$) and \"gaussian\" ($w(x) = e^{-x^2 / 2\\sigma^2}$). Finally, the number of Cleveland's _robustifying iterations_ is controllable through `niter`. After computing an estimate of $y(x)$, the weights are modulated by a function of the distance between the estimate and the points and the procedure is started over. These iterations are made to weaken the effect of outliers on the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next example shows the application of the LOESS to 2 years of daily temperature data. The red curve is the weighting function centered on January 1st 2014, the red circles are the nearest-neighbors. The black line and dot are the estimated $y$, outputs of the `sdba.loess.loess_smoothing` function, using local linear regression (passing $d = 1$), a window spanning 20% ($f = 0.2$) of the domain, the \"tricube\" weighting function and only one iteration."
